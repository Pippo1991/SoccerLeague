## What is soccerleague?

soccerleague is idea of a soccer management game for web, with match engine based on real soccer statistics and a 2D match visualyzer using HTML5/CANVAS

More, you can create your team, manager your squad, tactics, etc... and play matches with your friends and other managers, trying get a trophy.

## About development
I am using HTML5, Canvas, CSS3, JS(jquery too), and PHP 7.
This project looks a way to learning too. I'm learning PHP7 in the moment, and i will try put some concepts here.

##About MatchEngine
The match engine isn't being development yet. But i planed use real soccer statistics based in articles and books, like:

Reep, C., and B. Benjamin. Skill and Chance in Association Football: Journal of    the    Royal    Statistical    Society. 1968,    p.581â€“585.    Available in: <http://doi.org/10.2307/2343726>

Trying make the more realistics as possible.


## About MatchVisualyzer
I planed use canvas to do that. So, with engine generating a second to second match, i can do like FM 2008, with the match in 2D.

## About updates
I'm working in this now, but i expect launch SoccerLeague in end of 2016, the match engine will not lauch here, but the rest of the website will be.
